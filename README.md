The "Dars V3 Controller" is a desktop application designed to simplify the management and control of multiple Android devices simultaneously. It leverages the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to send commands quickly and efficiently. Through its simple interface, you can perform various tasks such as tapping, swiping, and running specific commands on all connected devices at once.
